# Visualize
The brain has a hard time distinquising between real and imagined events. When you're visualizing where you're going and how to get there, you are training the mind to  execute it too. You will experience lesss anxiety and stress when faces uncertain situations.

There are a few things to when practicing a visualization. First, it helps when you are in a relaxed and calm state of mind. This enables you to visualize more deeply without being distracted with other toughts and impulses. Second is to visualize from different perspectives; one time you visualize it like you're executing it, and other times from the perspective of someone around. Third; visualize worst case scenarios to best case scenarios and everything in between. Things will never unfold exactly how you anticipate it and therefore it is important to visualize every outcome.
## Examples
Great names have come before us and practiced visualization. Let me give some examples.

### Garrett Reisman
Garrett Reisman, one of the about 500 people who have been in space, talks about his inspiration source. He had a picture from space on his wall since a young age. It’s a simple Vision Board but it has worked for him very well. Watch the video in which he talks about it

When Garrett was facing though times, he looked at the picture and be reminded of why he is doing it all.

### Michael Phelps
Michael Phelps, at the time of writing the most succesful swimmer, started practicing visualizing when he was 11 years old. He would not only visualize the best case scenario for a match, but also visualize the scenarios where things go wrong. This way he would be ready for whatever comes his way. During the most important race of his career it happened that his goggles filled up with water, not being able to see a thing. However, with his countless visualizations done before and of course an enormous amount of practices, he was able to stay calm and count his strokes to continue to win the race.

## Create a Vision Board
A vision board is a collection of pictures of the end result you want to achieve. It will help you to clarify your goal. It turns your abstract ideas in your head into real images. If you want to get fit, then collect images of people that define ‘fit’ for you. At the same time be realistic because you have to believe that can be you one day.

Whether you are adding one or multiple pictures, it’s important to only use pictures that visualize your goal as precisely as possible. The more precise it is, the higher the chance is you’ll achieve exactly what you want. Find those pictures on the internet if you are making a Vision board with digital tools like Canva or Adobe Illustrator, or print them out and cut pictures from magazines if you like to get your hands dirty.

Add affirmations and inspirational quotes to the vision board. It doesn’t only have to be images.

When you are finished with your vision board, it is important to put it at a place where you are reminded of your vision regularly. You can set it as your picture of your goal on Strive Journal, or as a desktop background, or print it out and attach it somewhere in your bedroom so you are reminded of it every time you wake up.

You’ll notice that the Law of Attraction is helping you. Especially when you share it with other people things might go faster than you expect! Everyone likes to help other people and someone you know might be very good at something you didn’t expect, or know someone who is.

Next step is to create a detailed plan. Also called a Roadmap.
