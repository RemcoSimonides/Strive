# How to Stay Focused

## Schedule Revision
Plan time to think about important questions. Assess whether you still want to work on the goals you’re working. And, are you even spending your time in a way that contributes to the goals you have?

### Annually
Ask yourself these questions annually:

**How are you doing in these aspects of life? Rate from 1 – 10**
- Relationsips
- Financial
- Health
- Relaxation
- Spiritually
Also give a score where you would like it to be. Make a plan on how you are going to get that aspect to the desired score. Compare the results against the results from last year and see how you’ve improved.

**Are you still surrounded with the right people?** You become the average of the 5 people you spend most time with. Who are these 5 people? If you look how these people are, do you still want to be the average of them? Even though you don’t like to hurt people, you might want to consider spending less time with certain people, and more time with people you get a more positive energy from.
What is your plan for the next year? Adjust existing goals and set up new ones. Let’s make it another fantastic year.
Don’t forget to look back what you’ve accomplished last year and appreciate. We overestimate what we can do in the short-term, but underestimate what we can do in the long-term.

### Monthly
Ask yourself these questions monthly:
**How will your life change if you achieve your goals?** Manifesting what you’re doing it for is a form of intrinsic motivation. Don’t loose sight of the target.
**Which excuses did you come up with for yourself past month?** We often have self-limiting believes. Don’t ever blame someone else if you didn’t accomplish something you should have. What could you have done differently in that situation? Focus on what you have influence on.
**What did you spent time and attention on which should have been invested in your goal?** Especially nowadays we are easily distracted. Think about what you spent your time on. Next time you catch yourself spending time on this thing, you might recognize it faster and snap out of it.
**What is your plan for the next month?** Adjust existing goals and set up new ones. Let’s make it another fantastic month.
Strive Journal sends you a monthly email for these questions.

### Weekly
Ask yourself these questions weekly:
**What do you need to be more efficient?** For example it might help you to have a certain person to help you, or an upgraded computer, or a work-space, an app that is specialized in what you need. Small improvements like these compound over time.
**What were three things that went well this week, and what were three things that didn’t go well?** A moment of reflection.
**What is your plan for the next week?** Adjust existing goals and set up new ones. Let’s make it another fantastic month.

### Daily
**What did you do yesterday, what are you going to do today?** It’s as simple as that. It will give you focus for the day, and more importantly, you can relax after you’ve achieved it.
Don’t end when you’re stuck, but only stop when you know how to continue. This will help getting you back to work more easily.
Also note that when you overwork, you will pay for it the next day. So stop whenever you’ve done enough for that day. It will make you more efficient the next day.

You can also share the list with a mentor or [life coach](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/coaching/results-coaching/). Sharing your list will make you more accountable and give you a partner who will work with you through frustrations or roadblocks.
