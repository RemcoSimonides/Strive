# How to Create a Goal?
Click on 'ADD GOAL' and fill in the fields. No need to do it perfect in one go, you can always edit it later.
Read the [Create the perfect goal](category/create-the-perfect-goal) guide for all the details and explanation of what to fill in

## Privacy
When creating the goal, you will get the question "Who is able to see your goal?" There are two options:
- **Everyone**: The goal will be able to be seen by anyone, visible on your profile page and searchable on the explore page
- **Only you**: The goal is invisible but you can invite people to join it by using the share link
