# The Story
Eligible: **Admins** and **Achievers**

Look back at your achievement with pride! Add a post to your story with a title, description and an image. Scroll down to the Story section and click on "Add to Story" to add another post. Each milestone also has a Story section - there you can find everything about that specific milestone.

When you finish the goal or a milestone, you'll be automatically asked to create a post. Show to your supporters that you actually did it.

## Add a link to another website
Adding a url in the "Link" field will trigger an automatic fetch of data from the website and fill in the title, description and image for you!
