Eligible: **Admins** and **Achievers**

Break your goal up in smaller steps (milestones). Start with the end goal in mind, then think backwards which steps need to be taken in order to get to the end.

## Milestones
<PartialMilestone/>

## Complete a milestone
Failing is part of the journey, that's why it possible to choose "failed" when marking the milestone as completed. After completion, supporters will receive a notification and can then choose to give a support or not. To show your supporters (and your future self) that you actually did it, it is recommended to add a post to the story.
