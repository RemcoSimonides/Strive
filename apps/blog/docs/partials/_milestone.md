How small should the steps be? That is totally up to you of course. It is however best to be as detailed as possible so you move towards your goal more efficiently. At the same time, it takes a lot of time to be this detailed. Personally I like to write down in such details to make it fun to read back on it later. For example, it is nice to read back that I ran 200km in one month, but not all the 7km runs I did every day. The 200km in one month milestone was enough to give me motivation and to strive towards the goal of running a marathon.
