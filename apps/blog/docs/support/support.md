# Support a goal or milestone
Go to a goal you which to support. Here you can choose to either support the goal and/or one milestone if there is a roadmap defined. Once the goal or milestone is finished, you will receive a notification. In that moment you can decide to whether to give it or not. It is also possible to give the support at any time.

Goals you support will now be displayed on your Goals page at the top. You will be notified if any update has been made within the goal.

An overview of all the goals or milestones you support can be found at `Supports => For others`.
