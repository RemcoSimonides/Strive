# Supports for you
Several ways to see what people support you for
- All supports: Go to `Supports => For You` to see all supports
- Per goal: Go to a goal and click on `Support`
- Per milestone: Click on a milestone of a goal and then on `Support`

## When do you receive it?
- Once you've finished a goal
- Once you've completed a milestone (failed or succeeded)
- Whenever the supporter chooses to give it

And then the supporter still has to give it to you in real life.
