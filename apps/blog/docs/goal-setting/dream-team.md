# Gather your Dream Team
You can achieve it by yourself, however it is faster if you do it together!
Who to get on board? You will be surprised how many people are willing to help because helping is fun! It can be your friends, family or anyone who has walked your path before and is willing to help you to avoid the same mistakes, or to inspire you, like coaches. Also, it can be people who believe in a similar cause if your goal is for example to clean the neighborhood.
Most important is, who do you want to have on board? Think big! Who inspired you to start this goal in the first place? Send them a message because who doesn’t try, never wins.

## Accountability
Inviting others to your goal gives you accountability. Accountability works motivational and thus increase the chance of you succeeding. Is your plan good? Are you still focused on your goal? Maybe you can get supports on the milestones you’ve defined to gain something before the end goal.
