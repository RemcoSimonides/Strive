## Examples

### Garrett Reisman

## Create a Vision Board
A vision board is a collection of pictures of the end result you want to achieve. It will help you to clarify your goal. It turns your abstract ideas in your head into real images. If you want to get fit, then collect images of people that define ‘fit’ for you. At the same time be realistic because you have to believe that can be you one day.

Whether you are adding one or multiple pictures, it’s important to only use pictures that visualize your goal as precisely as possible. The more precise it is, the higher the chance is you’ll achieve exactly what you want. Find those pictures on the internet if you are making a Vision board with digital tools like Canva or Adobe Illustrator, or print them out and cut pictures from magazines if you like to get your hands dirty.

Add affirmations and inspirational quotes to the vision board. It doesn’t only have to be images.

When you are finished with your vision board, it is important to put it at a place where you are reminded of your vision regularly. You can set it as your picture of your goal on Strive Journal, or as a desktop background, or print it out and attach it somewhere in your bedroom so you are reminded of it every time you wake up.

You’ll notice that the Law of Attraction is helping you. Especially when you share it with other people things might go faster than you expect! Everyone likes to help other people and someone you know might be very good at something you didn’t expect, or know someone who is.

Next step is to create a detailed plan. Also called a Roadmap.
