# Dear Future Self Exercise
Write a message to yourself and receive it (far) in the future. You'll be amazed with how much of it came true.

## How it works
- Go to the [Dear Future Self Exercise](https://strivejournal.com/exercise/dear-future-self)
- Write a message which you want to receive in the future
- Choose delivery date in 2 years, 5 years or 10 years - or choose any date of your liking
- Send message

:::note
You won't be able to read the message until the date has come when you receive it.
:::

- Once the day has come that you receive your letter, you will receive an email and a push notification. Click on the push notification to view your letter.
- Received messages can be read at any time.

## Privacy
Messages to your future self are likely to be personal. To prevent anyone from Strive Journal to be able to read what you wrote down, the entries are **encrypted**. The only thing that is saved in the database is this kind of unreadable text `U2FsdGVkX18VtcXgXA/yKatzN4frKoDCUMUCgCSp/siCYtHYQvDAlNvtwRqTtxqd`
