# Daily Gratitude Exercise
Reminding the things you are grateful for trains your mind to focus on the positive instead of the negative. Receive a daily push notification to remind you to think of three things you are grateful for that day.

## How it works
import HowToDailyGratitude from '../../partials/how-to/_daily-gratitude.md';

## Privacy
What you are grateful for that day, can be very personal. To prevent anyone from Strive Journal to be able to read what you wrote down, the entries are **encrypted**. The only thing that is saved in the database is this kind of unreadable text `U2FsdGVkX18VtcXgXA/yKatzN4frKoDCUMUCgCSp/siCYtHYQvDAlNvtwRqTtxqd`
