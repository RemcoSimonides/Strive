# Daily Gratefulness Exercise
Reminding the things you are grateful for trains your mind to focus on the positive instead of the negative. Receive a daily push notification to remind you to think of three things you are grateful for that day.

## How it works
- Go to the [Daily Gratefulness Exercise](https://strivejournal.com/exercise/daily-gratefulness)
- Toggle the switch and set a time at which you would like to receive a push notification
- You will now receive a push notification every day. If you click on the push notification, then you can enter three things you were grateful for that day.
- By swiping, you can read previous entries to your gratefulness journal

## Privacy
What you are grateful for that day, can be very personal. To prevent anyone from Strive Journal to be able to read what you wrote down, the entries are **encrypted**. The only thing that is saved in the database is this kind of unreadable text `U2FsdGVkX18VtcXgXA/yKatzN4frKoDCUMUCgCSp/siCYtHYQvDAlNvtwRqTtxqd`
