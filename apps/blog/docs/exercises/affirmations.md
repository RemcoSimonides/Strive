# Affirmations Exercise

## How it works
- Go to the [Affirmations Exercise](https://strivejournal.com/exercise/affirmations)
- Pick up to three times in a day when to receive a random push notification with your affirmation
- Add unlimited custom affirmations or pick from the suggested affirmations list
- Optional: click on the received push notification to see it in full screen

## Deactivate
You can stop receiving push notifications by either removing all the set times, or removing all the affirmations.

## Privacy
Affirmations can be personal. To prevent anyone from Strive Journal to be able to read what you wrote down, the entries are **encrypted**. The only thing that is saved in the database is this kind of unreadable text `U2FsdGVkX18VtcXgXA/yKatzN4frKoDCUMUCgCSp/siCYtHYQvDAlNvtwRqTtxqd`
