## Why should I Self Reflect?
Carving out moments for self reflection is an effort that should outway the benefits. Let's go over a few of the benefits of doing self reflection every once in a while.

### Increase your self awareness
By pausing for a moment to reflect on the past, present, and the future, you enable yourself to think deeply about your feelings and behavior. It gives you time to think why you like a certain thing, whether this thing aligns with your morals and long term vision. It enables you to better understand your emotions. Not everything is likely how you would like it to be so during this exercise you will also discover areas that can be improved.

### Goal alignment
Are you current behavios in-line with your long-term goals? Are you spending your time on the things that will benefit you in the long-term? "Energy flows where attention goes" is what Tony Robbins says. Are you spending your attention in the right areas?

### Improved decision making
By reflecting on what you can do better in the future, it also makes making decisions easier. You will be more self aware of what you should or shouldn't do and therefore it's easier to think about this when making a decision.

### Personal Growth and Development
Identify patterns, strenghts and areas for improvement. Be honest with yourself.

## Customize Questions
Everyone has different desires about what they want to reflect on. That is why in Strive Journal, it is possible to adjust the frequency of the existing questions or to add your own. This way you have full control over what you would like to reflect on.

### Add Questions
In Strive Journal on the Self Reflect page, scroll all the way down to the "Add Question" button. A modal will open and in here you can insert several things, first of which is the question you would like to add.
