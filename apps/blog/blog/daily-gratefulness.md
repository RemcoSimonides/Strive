## What is Daily Gratefulness?
Daily Gratefulness is the practice of taking a moment to think about what you are grateful for. With enough practice, this exercise will shift your mind to more positive thoughts rather than the negative thoughts. Also, it will shift your awareness to what you have rather than what you want.
