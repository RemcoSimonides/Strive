## What is Daily Gratitude?
Daily Gratitude is the practice of taking a moment to think about what you are grateful for. With enough practice, this exercise will shift your mind to more positive thoughts rather than the negative thoughts. Also, it will shift your awareness to what you have rather than what you want.

## How it works in Strive Journal
import HowToDailyGratitude from '../partials/how-to/_daily-gratitude.md';

With Strive Journal it is possible to receive a daily reminder to remind you to take a moment and write down what you are grateful for.
