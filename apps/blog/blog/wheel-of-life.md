## What is the Wheel of Life?
With the Wheel of Life you rate several areas in your life based on how you feel about it. It will visualize which area in your life is lacking and which is prospering. In order to create balance in your life, it is important that all areas in balance. Once everything is in balance, the graph will look like a wheel.

We all have the tendencie to focus on areas in life where we are more proficient in and neglect the ones we are less proficient in. For example you are good at your work and earn a lot of money, but your family at home therefore doesn't get enough attention.

## Clear your mind
In order to fill in the Wheel of Life, your mind should be clear. If you are just going through a tough time, it is better not to fill in the Wheel of Life because it is likely that you are biased for some areas in life. Also, it is important not to answer based on what you "should" answer but really what you feel.

Go somewhere quiet, perhaps do a meditation before, and __take your time__.
