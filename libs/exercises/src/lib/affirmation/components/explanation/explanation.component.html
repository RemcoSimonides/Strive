<h4>What is an affirmation?</h4>
<p>An affirmation is a short, powerful statement. They allow you to conciously be in control of your thoughts. When you say or think them, they become thoughts that shape your reality. To affirm is to say something positively, so an affirmation is firmly declaring a positive thought and assertively stating it as a truth.</p>

<h4>Why should I use them?</h4>
<p>By making these positive declarations part of your daily life, you are helping your mind to prioritise positively over negativity.</p>

<h4>How to write affirmations that work?</h4>
<p>
  <b>Step 1:</b> Beginning your affirmation with the words ‘I am’ makes it powerful.<br/>
  It uses language that gives your subconscious mind a command. Your mind then interprets it as a directive that it must follow through on.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Step 2:</b> Use present tense.<br/>
  Speak about things as if you already have them. It helps your mind to visualise the outcome. For example, you can use ‘I have a beautiful beach house flooded with sunlight’ instead of ‘this year I am going to buy a beach house’.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Step 3:</b> Speak about what you do want.<br/>
  Do not use negatives in your affirmation. Your subscious mind does not recognise negatives. So if you say, ‘don’t shut yourself off to new opportunities’, all your mind hears is ‘shut yourself off…’ Instead, try saying ‘I am open to new opportunities’.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Step 4:</b> Keep it brief.<br/>
  Don’t write an essay. It is easier to remember something that that is short and snappy. Think “I naturally choose healthy foods”, rather than “I always choose healthy foods over junk food because I’m mindful of my health”.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Step 5:</b> Be specific.<br/>
  Including a specific makes it easier for your mind to visualise the outcome. So instead of saying, ‘I will increase my income this year’, say ‘I am enjoying my $100,000 earnings this year’.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Step 6:</b> Write it for you.<br/>
  Make sure your affirmations describe your own actions and not the actions of others.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Step 7:</b> Make it mean something.<br/>
  Make sure your affirmation means something to you. It has to be meaningful on all levels. Speaks to you and crafted correctly.
