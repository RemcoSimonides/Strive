  <h3>3. How do we process your personal data</h3>

  <h4>3.1 Creating an account</h4>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Password</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can also use your Google account to register. If you do so, we may gain access to public profile information such as your name and email address.

    We process this data as it is necessary to deliver Strive Journal to you.
  </p>

  <h4>3.2 Using Strive Journal with an account</h4>
  <p>
    It is up to you how you use Strive Journal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on how you use Strive Journal, we process the following data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your personal info, such as name, email address and profile picture</li>
    <li>Your added goals and their roadmap, story and chat</li>
    <li>Whom you follow and who follows you</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can delete all of your added content whenever you like. When you do, it will no longer be visible to others and be deleted from our servers.
  </p>

  <h4>3.3 Sharing your Goals</h4>
  <p>
    Strive Journal is a community. We allow you to not only keep a journal of your goals for yourself, but to share them with whomever you like.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can change the sharing settings for a specific goal at any time. For every goal, you can choose with whom you want to share your experience:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Invites only - This goal is only visible to the people that have been invited to the goal. When sharing the goal, a url with a token is created which is available for 24 hours. After 24 hours, this url is not valid anymore.
    <li>Everyone - Inspire fellow achievers! Everyone can see your goal and its roadmap and story.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The chat of the goal can only be read by people who have the role ‘admin’, ‘achiever’ or ‘supporter’. It cannot be read by people without an account or by people that only follow the goal. For more information about what each role can do within a goal, please refer to the <a href="https://blog.strivejournal.com/goal/team">team guide</a>.
